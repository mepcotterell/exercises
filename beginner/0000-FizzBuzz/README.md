# FizzBuzz

Write a simple program that displays the numbers 1 through 100 (inclusive), each
on its own line, except: i) if the number is divisible by 3, then display "Fizz"
instead of the number; ii) if the number is divisible by 5, then display "Buzz"
instead of the number; iii) if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, then 
display "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

## Divisibility

Here is a version of the math definition: Given an integer number 
<code>n</code>, we say that <code>n</code> is divisible by an integer 
<code>d</code> if, and only if, there exists some integer <code>m</code> such 
that <code>n = d * m</code>.

Another way to think of this is as follows: If you have an integer number
<code>n</code>, then we say that <code>n</code> is divisibly by some 
integer <code>d</code> if, using regular math, <code>n / d</code> evaluates
to an integer result.
